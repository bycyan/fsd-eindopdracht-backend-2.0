Testing your application thoroughly is crucial to ensure its reliability and security. It seems like you have several components related to security and user authentication. Here's a general guide on how you can approach testing for each of these components:

CorsConfig:

Test that CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration allows or denies requests from specific origins as intended.
Use tools like curl or testing frameworks like Postman to send requests with different origins and ensure the server responds correctly.
SecurityConfig:

Test the security configurations, especially authentication and authorization settings.
Write unit tests for each security rule, such as ensuring that specific endpoints are secured, roles are checked correctly, etc.
Simulate authentication and authorization scenarios to ensure only authorized users can access protected resources.
User Model:

Write tests to validate the behavior of your User model.
Test that user creation, updating, and deletion work as expected.
Ensure that validation constraints (if any) are enforced properly.
Jwt Request Filter:

Write unit tests for your Jwt Request Filter to ensure it correctly extracts and validates JWTs.
Test different scenarios, such as valid JWT, expired JWT, invalid signature, etc.
Ensure that the filter handles unauthorized requests appropriately.
Authority:

Write tests to verify the behavior of the Authority class.
Ensure that authorities are assigned to users correctly.
Test scenarios where a user has multiple authorities.
JwtUtil:

Write tests for JwtUtil to verify token creation, validation, and extraction.
Test edge cases such as token expiration, invalid tokens, etc.
General Testing Tips:

Use testing frameworks like JUnit, TestNG, or your preferred testing tool for writing unit tests.
Implement both positive and negative test cases.
Use mocking frameworks (e.g., Mockito) to isolate components and focus on the unit you are testing.
Consider integration tests to check the interaction between different components.
Remember to mock external dependencies like databases, external services, etc., to ensure that your tests are isolated and don't rely on external factors. Automated testing is a continuous process, so consider incorporating it into your development workflow to catch issues early and maintain the reliability of your application.
